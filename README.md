# 🛡️ CEH Labs – EC-Council

Hello! I’m **Petras Guilherme Kulyumba**, a cybersecurity enthusiast working toward mastery in ethical hacking and offensive security. This repository documents my hands-on practice based on the **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)** curriculum.

I created these labs to simulate real-world cyberattack scenarios, sharpen my penetration testing skills, and demonstrate my understanding of security mechanisms, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find in Each Lab

Each lab folder includes:
- 📝 **Objective** – What I aimed to learn or prove
- 🔧 **Tools Used** – Examples: Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Wireshark, SQLMap
- 📜 **Methodology** – Step-by-step attack or testing approach
- 📸 **Screenshots or Outputs** – Evidence of the lab being executed
- 🛡️ **Mitigation** – How to defend against the attack

These are all executed in a **safe lab environment** using platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, or local VMs.
