# 🛡️ CEH Labs – EC-Council

Hello! I’m **Petras Guilherme Kulyumba**, a cybersecurity enthusiast working toward mastery in ethical hacking and offensive security. This repository documents my hands-on practice based on the **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)** curriculum.

I created these labs to simulate real-world cyberattack scenarios, sharpen my penetration testing skills, and demonstrate my understanding of security mechanisms, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures.
